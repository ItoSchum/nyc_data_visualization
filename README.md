## How to join these datasets

Through this project, we plan to find out the relations within some datasets of New York City: the crime dataset, the liquor store dataset, the air quality dataset and the Airbnb dataset. Because we think some of the factors referred to above may have effects on the others. For instance, the location where many crimes are spotted may have much liquor authority, and more Airbnb houses may locate in the place with higher air quality.
